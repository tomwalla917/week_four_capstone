# ðŸŸ¡ DOM Capstone Project: Character Gallery & Detail

## Instructions

This capstone project will challenge you to use all the DOM, events, and localStorage skills youâ€™ve learned this week. You will build a two-page app:

- **Page 1 (Gallery):**  
  Users can add a Dragon or Human character (with name, image, and description) to a gallery. All characters are stored in localStorage. Clicking a character card takes you to a detail page for that character.

- **Page 2 (Character Detail):**  
  On this page, users can view the characterâ€™s details and add items (runes, weapons, potions) to the characterâ€™s bag. These items are stored in an array inside the characterâ€™s object in localStorage.

---

### Step-by-Step

#### 1. **Gallery Page (`index.html` + `gallery.js`)**

- Create a form to add a new character:
  - Type (Dragon or Human)
  - Name
  - Description
  - Image URL
- When the form is submitted:
  - Add the character to an array in localStorage (use `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse`).
  - Render all characters as cards in a gallery below the form.
- Each card should display the characterâ€™s image, name, type, and description.
- When a card is clicked:
  - Save the characterâ€™s index (or unique ID) to `sessionStorage`.
  - Redirect to the detail page (`detail.html`).

#### 2. **Character Detail Page (`detail.html` + `detail.js`)**

- On page load:
  - Read the selected characterâ€™s index from `sessionStorage`.
  - Load the character from localStorage and display their details.
- Show a list of items in the characterâ€™s bag (if any).
- Provide a form to add a new item to the bag:
  - Item type (Rune, Weapon, Potion)
  - Item name
- When the form is submitted:
  - Add the item to the characterâ€™s `bag` array in localStorage.
  - Update the displayed bag list.

#### 3. **General Requirements**

- Use the DOM API for all element creation, event handling, and updates.
- Use localStorage for persistent data and sessionStorage for temporary navigation state.
- Use CSS to style your pages and cards for a polished look.
- Test your app by adding, viewing, and updating multiple characters and their bags.

## Discuss

- How did you structure your data in localStorage? Why?
- What challenges did you face with DOM manipulation and event handling?
- How did you ensure data persists and updates correctly between pages?
- How could you extend this project? (e.g., editing/removing characters, more item types, images for items, etc.)
- What are the pros and cons of using localStorage and sessionStorage for this kind of app?
- How would you refactor your code for scalability or to use a framework/library?

**This is an extreme challenge! Work together, use your notes and resources, and ask questions as you go. Good luck!**
